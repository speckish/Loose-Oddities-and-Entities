"I swung the door shut behind me, the many unnecessary inner locks that grandpa had installed for who knows what reason, clacking together."
"The smell of the contents of the thankfully now empty refrigerator lingered throughout the entire entry way, and it wouldn't be leaving anytime soon."

"Another strange quirk to his house. So far, every window I have seen was taped, boarded, or otherwise covered. I haven't explored the upstairs yet, but I assume the same to those."
"That's not even mentioning the halo of tape around the front door."

"…It was weird being here. It was weird for it to be a place in the family, and yet this time—after his death—is the first I ‘ve ever set foot in the place."
#note: Expression Drew enf, mn
"My mom used to complain a lot about him not inviting us over, commiserating {i}at{/i} me for him not making an active effort to be in my life, swearing up and down in actual swears, my poor childhood ears that he was always this way and would never change."
"Slowly over the years, she stopped complaining. She stopped sending him rarely-accepted invites to my birthdays. And finally, she stopped mentioning him whatsoever."

"A dead silence and a dead grandfather were the only things greeting me now."

"My eyes wander to the mantle where I left his urn when I first came into his home."

"Mom doesn't want it, so we'll probably take a trip out to the sea and dump him out in an unceremonious ceremony. Who knows what he actually wanted."
"When you pass away on a park bench and you don't have your ID, so the police can't identify you for over a week, {i}and{/i} your only daughter doesn't care enough about you, well, you kind of get rushed through the process."

"Maybe I'll find a half-written will somewhere in here. Some of it might be a bit too late, but hey, I will do what I can do. {w=0.5}I guess."

"There is only one reason I agreed to do this in the first place. And it is not because of my grandfather. We weren't close. I can probably count the amount of times we met in the past thirty years of my life on one hand."
#note: Expression Drew enf, bn, mf, extra_sweat
"It's also not because I can count the amount of family members left in this family on two fingers exactly, and my mother plainly stated she had no interest in seeing the house rundown with garbage nor did she have the time since she's the “sole-breadwinner” in the family."
#note: Expression Drew -extra_sweat
"Maybe it's because my mother didn't like him much. Maybe he didn't like us either. Maybe I'm curious to find out the reasons."
"She asked me to do it. Perhaps, ask is not the correct word. Strongly recommend? Forced me out of the house?"
#note: Expression Drew ecs, bh, msh
"It's not my fault I lost my job, and it's her fault for not understanding it's hard to find a new one at the speed she wants it to happen—automatically. Yeah, not happening."
"So here I am, in this house stinking of rotten food and water damage. Striking her proverbial two birds with one stone—getting rid of his mess, so she can try to sell this place, and getting my mess out of her house. And the third strike: my curiosity thank goodness this isn't baseball."
"I think it will need a few coats of paint and an air purifier at the very least. I hope she doesn't task me that far."
#note: Expression Drew ec, bn, msh
"I roll my shoulders back and heave a sigh."

d"Well, it's not like it's going to clean itself while I contemplate my hell."
"After considering throwing an old can of corn chowder through a window pane who screws windows closed? in the kitchen to grant me precious clean oxygen after opening the refrigerator…well, maybe cleaning somewhere potentially a lot less gross would be good."
"I remember my mom mentioning there was an office upstairs next to her old room. Old papers and pens, more papers, more pens. Maybe some boxes. But no rotten fruit or moldy bread."
"At least, I hope."
scene front_door
"I turn on my heel out of the living room, cross the entryway, and step onto the stairwell. All the steps feel sturdy, but a few of them sure don't {i}sound{/i} sturdy."
scene hallway
"The upstairs hallway feels cramped with so many doors on both sides. The door on the far left-side… It had a door plate with swoopy cursive letters on it: {i}Beth{/i}. My mom's childhood bedroom, then."
#note: Expression Drew ecs, bn, msh
"That is definitely a mess for ano—!"

"A muffled thud from one of the rooms breaks my mental monologue."
d"… for later?"
"I stare at the closed door for a long second."
"At worst, ghosts... {w=0.5}No, actually: at worst, a raccoon."
#note: Expression Drew ews, bw, mf
"I suck in a deep breath, contemplating the office door right in front of me and the door that might be another kitchen-level disaster waiting for me."
